# Bayesian penguins
## Introduction to Bayesian statistics in R and Stan
This repository contains an introductory tutorial to [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr) and can be cloned to RStudio as an R project. The presentation is `peng-bayes.pdf` and the main R script `peng-bayes.R`. `linear.R` contains some alternative linear models. This script is not annotated. Finally there are a variety of images that are called in `peng-bayes.R`. `penguins_linear.tiff` and `penguins_linear_c.tiff` are created in `linear.R`. Here are the credits for the remainder:

- `snails.tiff` Figure S2 from [my paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05143-4), which also has a [repo](https://github.com/lukaseamus/Phorcus).
