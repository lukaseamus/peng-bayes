# Bayesian penguins
## Introduction to Bayesian statistics in Stan via R
This repository contains an introductory tutorial to `cmdstanr` and can be cloned as an R project in RStudio. The presentation is `peng-bayes.pdf` and the main R script `peng-bayes.R`. `linear.R` contains some alternative linear models. This script is not annotated. Finally there are a variety of images that are called in `peng-bayes.R`. `penguins_linear.tiff` and `penguins_linear_c.tiff` are created in `linear.R`. Here are the credits for the remainder:
